# Efficient-Encrypted-Data-Search
This study addresses the issues faced by the traditional searching system by proposing an efficient Encrypted Data Search (EnDAS) scheme as a mobile cloud service. This innovative scheme uses a lightweight trapdoor (encrypted keyword) compression method, which optimizes the data communication process by reducing the trapdoorâ€™s size for traffic efficiency. In this study, we also propose two optimization methods for document search, called the Trapdoor Mapping Table (TMT) module and Ranked Serial Binary Search (RSBS) algorithm, to speed the search time.
